Using tools like budgeting apps or spreadsheets can help track finances and avoid unnecessary stress.</p>

                    <h3 className="text-h3-sm sm:text-h3-base">Household Maintenance.</h3>
                    <p>Keeping a clean and organized living space is essential for comfort and health. Basic skills like cleaning, laundry, cooking, and minor repairs can go a long way in maintaining a functional home. These tasks not only ensure a pleasant living environment but also contribute to a sense of pride and independence.</p>
                    <br/>

Good time management reduces stress and ensures you can meet deadlines while also making time for relaxation and hobbies.</p>

                    <h3 className="text-h3-sm sm:text-h3-base">Personal Health and Wellness</h3>
