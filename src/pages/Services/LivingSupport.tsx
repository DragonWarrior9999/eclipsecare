                        <br/>
                        <p>Supported Independent Living refers to funding provided by the NDIS to assist participants with disabilities to live independently in their own homes or shared living arrangements. It covers support for daily tasks and activities, enabling individuals to build skills and live as autonomously as possible.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <ul><h3>Living Arrangements</h3>
                        <br/>
                            <li>- Typically provided in shared housing arrangements or group homes.</li>
                            <li>- Can also be offered for individuals living alone or with family.</li>
                            <li>- SIL services can adapt to your preferred living setup.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <ul><h3>Who is eligible for SIL?</h3>
                        <br/>
                        Participants must demonstrate a need for substantial support with daily living activities. The NDIS assesses this based on:
                            <li>- The participantâ€™s level of disability.</li>
                            <li>- Their goals and aspirations outlined in the NDIS plan.</li>
                        </ul>
